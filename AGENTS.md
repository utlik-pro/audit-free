# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- **`src/`**: React + TypeScript application code. Pages live in `src/pages`, shared UI in `src/components`, hooks in `src/hooks`, and utilities in `src/utils`.
- **`public/`**: Static assets bundled with Vite. Place immutable files (logos, favicons) here.
- **`supabase/`**: Remote configuration, policies, and migrations. SQL snippets mirror the contents of `supabase_migration.sql`.
- **`dist/`**: Build artifacts generated by Vite; never edit manually.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Vite dev server on the default port with hot reload.
- **`npm run build`**: Produces an optimized production bundle under `dist/`.
- **`npm run build:dev`**: Generates a development-targeted bundle to debug deployment issues.
- **`npm run preview`**: Serves the most recent build locally for verification.
- **`npm run lint`**: Runs ESLint across the workspace; ensure a clean run before pushing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- **TypeScript**: Prefer explicit types for props and exported functions. Avoid `any` unless unavoidable.
- **Styling**: Components use Tailwind utility classes defined in `tailwind.config.ts`. Keep class lists alphabetical when practical.
- **Imports**: Group React, third-party, and local imports, using relative paths rooted at `src/`.
- **Formatting**: Honor ESLint and editorconfig defaultsâ€”2-space indentation and single quotes in JSX attributes.

## Testing Guidelines
- **Framework**: No automated tests are configured yet. If you introduce tests, align with Vite + Vitest conventions under `src/__tests__/`.
- **Manual checks**: Validate core flows (report generation, Supabase interactions, PDF export) via `npm run preview` before opening a PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- **Commits**: Follow conventional-style prefixes (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) to match existing history. Keep commits scoped to a single concern.
- **Pull Requests**: Provide a concise summary, link relevant tickets, and list verification steps (commands run, screenshots for UI tweaks). Include Supabase migration notes when schema changes land.

## Supabase & Deployment Notes
- **Environment**: Secrets reside in `.env.local`; never commit them. Reference `SUPABASE_MIGRATION.md` before altering SQL files.
- **Deployments**: Production deploys run through Vercel (`vercel.json`). Ensure `npm run build` succeeds and linting passes prior to triggering a deployment.
